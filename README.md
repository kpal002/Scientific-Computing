# Scientific-Computing
Different algorithms related to finding solutions of linear and non linear equations implemented during a graduate course on Scientific Computing. https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~shinar/courses/cs210/

The following algorithms are implemented

1. Least Squares
2. QR decomposition
3. LU decomposition
4. jacobi iterative method. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method
5. Power method for calculating the dominant eigenvector. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration 
6. Rayleigh quotient method to find the dominant eigenvalue. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_quotient_iteration
