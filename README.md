# Scientific-Computing
Different algorithms related to finding solutions of linear and non linear equations implemented during a graduate course on Scientific Computing. https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~shinar/courses/cs210/

The following algorithms are implemented

1. Least Squares
2. QR decomposition
3. LU decomposition
4. Power and jacobi method
